# Excel---Analyze-NYSE-Data
Udacity Project 

In this project I analyzed data from the New York Stock Exchange. This is a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.

I started with a comparison between the total revenues of the energy sector companies for the third and fourth year. I calculated the the measures of central tendency and spread and made a presentation to interpret my insights supported with visualizations.

Then I created a Profit and Lost Statement for all Health Care sector companis. Finally basid on the historical data I created Financial Forecasting Model for a company from health care sector.
